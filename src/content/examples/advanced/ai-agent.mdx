With Tiptap, you can build an AI agent that can reason, define a plan, and edit your document. It makes decisions based on the user's feedback and the editor's state.

Tiptap is the rich text editor toolkit for AI Agents. Its [editor commands](/editor/api/commands) provide an interface for the AI to make precise edits to the document. And its [Content AI extensions](/content-ai/getting-started/overview) allow you to integrate AI content generation and assistance directly into your editor.

We're working on tools and templates to help developers build AI Agent applications. Our upcoming release will include a tool for reviewing AI-generated edits.
