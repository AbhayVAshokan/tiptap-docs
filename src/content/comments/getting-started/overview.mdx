The `comments` extension allows users to create threads and comments in your editor. Threads can be used to discuss specific parts of the document, or to add comments to specific parts of the document.

Comments can be accessed and manipulated through the Comments REST API or received via Webhooks, enabling the creation of notification systems and the addition of comments from outside the Editor.

<Callout title="Subscription required" variant="warning">
  This extension requires a valid Entry, Business or Enterprise subscription and a running [Tiptap
  Cloud instance](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/). To install the extension you need [access to our
  private registry](/guides/pro-extensions), set this up first.
