The `Comments` extension lets users create threads and comments in the editor. Threads can be used to discuss specific parts of the document, while individual comments can be added to particular sections.

Comments can be accessed and manipulated through the [Comments REST API](/comments/integrate/rest-api) or received via [webhooks](/comments/integrate/webhook), enabling the creation of notification systems and the ability to add comments from outside the Editor.
