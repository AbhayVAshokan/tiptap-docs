The Comments Editor API focuses on the client-side interactions for managing comments within the editor environment, enabling direct manipulation and customization of comment threads.

In contrast, the Comments [REST API](/comments/integrate/rest-api) is designed for server-side operations, allowing for management outside of your editor.
