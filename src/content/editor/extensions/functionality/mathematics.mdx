import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'
import { CodeDemo } from '@/components/CodeDemo'

This extension allows you to write and visualize even complex mathematical formulas or equations in your editor. Please note that the current version is still in a very basic stage.

<CodeDemo isPro path="/Extensions/Mathematics" />

## Install

<Callout title="Set up access to Tiptap's private repository" variant="info">
  Integrate this pro extension by registering for a free [Tiptap
  account](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/register) and following our [access
  guide](/guides/pro-extensions) to Tiptap’s private repository.
</Callout>

```bash
npm install @tiptap-pro/extension-mathematics katex
```

### Additional Setup

You are free to style the rendering element and the editor input.

**Import of KaTeX styling (needed).**

```js
import 'katex/dist/katex.min.css'
```

**The following classes allow you to select and style the math-decorations. For an example, see demonstration code at the end of this page.**

```css
/* Decoration containing the actual text */
.Tiptap-mathematics-editor {
  // …
}

/* Container of the KaTeX rendering */
.Tiptap-mathematics-render {
  // …
}
```

## Settings

### regex

Tiptap needs to know when the text is mathematical. Therefor a regular expression pattern allows us to define this shorthand. E.g. using the TeX shorthand `$ … $` (see default below). Matches become decorated – they are not stored as own nodes or marks!

Default: `/\$([^\$]*)\$/gi`

### katexOptions

For the math typesetting the extension uses the third party library [KaTeX](https://katex.org). To adjust its behaviour, you can pass KaTeX options to it. Find all of them [here](https://katex.org/docs/options.html).

Default: `undefined`

```js
import Mathematics from '@tiptap-pro/extension-mathematics'

// [...]

Mathematics.configure({
  katexOptions: {
    maxSize: 300,
  },
})
```
