By default, the AI Proofreader extension will automatically load suggestions when the editor is ready. You can disable this behavior with the `loadOnStart` option

```tsx
AiProofreader.configure({
  // Disable automatic loading of suggestions
  loadOnStart: false,
})
```

By default, the AI Proofreader extension will reload suggestions when the editor's content changes. You can disable this behavior with the `reloadOnUpdate` option

```tsx
AiProofreader.configure({
  // Disable automatic loading of suggestions
  reloadOnUpdate: false,
})
```

By default, the AI Proofreader extension will wait 800 milliseconds after the user stops typing to reload suggestions. This prevents the API from being called too frequently. You can configure this timeout with the `debounceTimeout` option

```tsx
AiProofreader.configure({
  debounceTimeout: 1000,
})
```

However, there are cases where you may want to force suggestions to reload. For example, you may want to reload suggestions when the user clicks a "refresh" button.

To reload suggestions manually, use the `loadAiProofreaderSuggestions` command.

```tsx
editor.commands.loadAiProofreaderSuggestions()
```

To load suggestions after a delay, use the `loadAiProofreaderSuggestionsDebounced` command. The delay is determined by the `debounceTimeout` option.

```tsx
editor.commands.loadAiProofreaderSuggestionsDebounced()
```

If you want to set the suggestions to a certain value, without loading them with the configured API, you can use the `setAiProofreaderSuggestions` command. This is useful in the following scenarios:

- When you have a list of suggestions that you want to display immediately.
- When you want to clear the suggestions.
- When you want to display suggestions from a different source than the API you configured in the extension's options.

```
editor.commands.setAiProofreaderSuggestions(suggestions);

```
