Because your document might have important information, you might not want all of it to be proofread. You might want to mark certain content as “locked”, and prevent the proofreader from generating suggestions that modify them.

We are working on an extension that implements this feature with minimal hassle. If you are interested in this upcoming feature and think you would use it in your application, contact us at humans@tiptap.dev.

In the meantime, you can prevent certain content from being proofread by filtering the suggestions generated by the resolver. You can implement your custom filter function that removes the suggestions that are applied to certain positions of the document, or that contain a specific type of content.

```tsx
AiProofreader.configure({
  async resolver({ defaultResolver, ...options }) {
    // Load suggestions
    const suggestions = await defaultResolver(options)
    // Remove suggestions that modify the locked content
    const filteredSuggestions = filterSuggestions(suggestions)
    return filteredSuggestions
  },
})

// Filter function that removes the suggestions that modify the content in positions between 10 and 20.
function filterSuggestions(suggestions) {
  return suggestions.filter(
    (suggestion) => suggestion.deleteRange.from > 20 || suggestion.deleteRange.to < 10,
  )
}
```
