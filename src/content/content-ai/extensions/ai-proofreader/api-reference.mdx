## Extension types

### Proofreading rules

```ts
/**
 * A rule to be applied during proofreading.
 */
export interface AiProofreaderRule {
  /**
   * Unique identifier for the rule.
   */
  id: string
  /**
   * The title of the rule. Will not be used for proofreading, but for display
   * purposes.
   */
  title: string
  /**
   * The prompt of the rule. Will be sent to the AI model for proofreading.
   */
  prompt: string
  /**
   * The color of the rule. Will be used to underline the content that must
   * be replaced to apply the rule.
   */
  color: string
  /**
   * The background color of the rule. Will be used to highlight the content
   * when the suggestion is selected.
   */
  backgroundColor: string
}
```

### Proofreading suggestions

```ts
import { Range } from '@tiptap/core'
import { Slice } from '@tiptap/pm/model'

import { AiProofreaderRule } from './ai-proofreader-rule'

/**
 * A replacement option for a suggestion. It contains the text to be added and
 * the slice to be replaced.
 */
export interface AiProofreaderReplacementOption {
  id: string
  /**
   * The text to be added when the replacement format is `plain-text`.
   */

  /**
   * The content to be added when the replacement format is `rich-text`.
   */

}

/**
 * A suggestion from the AI proofreader. It contains the range to be replaced,
 * the text to be deleted, the replacement options, and the rule that must be
 * applied.
 *
 * A suggestion can have multiple replacement options. The user can choose one
 * of them to apply the suggestion.
 */

   * The text to be deleted from the editor, in plain text format
   */

   * The content to be deleted from the editor, as a Prosemirror slice.
   */

   * Multiple replacement options for the suggestion. The user can choose one
   * of them to apply the suggestion.
   */

   * The proofreading rule that is followed by applying this suggestion.
   */
  rule: AiProofreaderRule
  /**
   * Whether the suggestion was rejected by the user.
   */
  isRejected: boolean
}
```

### Rejected Suggestions

```ts
import { AiProofreaderRule } from './ai-proofreader-rule'

/**
 * Represents a rejected suggestion. These are stored in the AI Proofreader extension's
 * storage so that the suggestion is not generated again.
 */
export interface AiProofreaderRejection {
  /**
   * The rule of the suggestion that was rejected.
   */
  rule: AiProofreaderRule
  /**
   * The text that was about to be deleted by the rejected suggestion.
   */
  deleteText: string
}
```
