With the AI Changes extension, you can introduce a review workflow for AI-generated content, so that users can correct and approve the changes made by the AI.

## Start tracking changes

To start tracking changes, use `startTrackingAiChanges` command.

```ts
editor.commands.startTrackingAiChanges()
```

This will store a snapshot of the editor's content at the moment of running the command. From then on, all new changes to the document will be compared to this snapshot, and displayed in the editor.

For this reason, the usual workflow is to run the `startTrackingAiChanges` command just before adding the AI-generated content to the editor. For example, you can chain it with a command of the [AI Generation extension](/content-ai/capabilities/generation/text-generation/built-in-commands):

```ts
editor
  .chain()
  .startTrackingAiChanges()
  .aiTextPrompt({ text: 'Write a blog post about Tiptap' })
  .run()
```

You can access the snapshot of the previous document with the `getPreviousDoc` method of the extension's storage object:

```ts
const storage = editor.extensionStorage.aiChanges
const previousDoc = storage.getPreviousDoc()
```

This will return a [Prosemirror `Node` object](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.Node) that represents the previous document.

When you call the `startTrackingAiChanges` command, you can provide an optional previous document. This is useful when you want to compare the new changes with a different document than the one currently in the editor.

```ts
editor.commands.startTrackingAiChanges(previousDoc)
```

## Reviewing changes

The AI Changes extension provides several extension storage methods to retrieve the tracked changes:

- `getChanges`: Returns a list of all the changes made to the document since the last time `startTrackingAiChanges` was called.
- `getSelectedChange`: Returns the currently selected change. A change is selected when the cursor is on top of it.
- `getIsTrackingAiChanges`: Returns a boolean that indicates if the editor is currently tracking AI changes.
- `getIsShowingAiChanges`: Returns a boolean that indicates if the editor is currently showing the AI changes. AI changes [can be temporarily hidden](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/features/display-changes#hide-and-show-changes) using the `setShowAiChanges` commands.
- `getPreviousDoc`: Returns the previous document before the AI made changes. If the extension is currently not tracking changes, this will be `null`.

To learn more about how to use these methods to display AI changes in your editor, check the [Display AI Changes](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/features/display-changes) guide.

## Accepting and rejecting changes

The AI Changes extension provides several commands to review changes.

To accept a change, call the `acceptAiChange` command. This will modify the snapshot of the previous document to include the change.

```ts
editor.commands.acceptAiChange(changeId)
```

To reject a change, call the `rejectAiChange` command. This will modify the current editor content to match the previous document in the range of that change.

```ts
editor.commands.rejectAiChange(changeId)
```

To accept all AI changes, use the `acceptAllAiChanges` command.

```ts
editor.commands.acceptAllAiChanges()
```

To reject all AI changes, use the `rejectAllAiChanges` command.

```ts
editor.commands.rejectAllAiChanges()
```

## Stop tracking changes

Finally, to stop tracking AI changes, run the `stopTrackingAiChanges` command. This will remove the snapshot of the previous document and stop tracking changes.

```ts
editor.commands.stopTrackingAiChanges()
```

The previous document snapshot will be set to `null`, and the editor will no longer display the changes made by the AI.

You can learn more about the AI Changes extension commands in the [API Reference](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/api-reference).
