Ever wondered how to track changes made by AI in your editor? The AI Changes extension allows you to review and accept or reject changes made by AI. It highlights the changes in the editor, making it easy to see what has been modified.

Combine it with the [AI Generation extension](/content-ai/capabilities/generation/overview) to generate content and then have your users review it.
