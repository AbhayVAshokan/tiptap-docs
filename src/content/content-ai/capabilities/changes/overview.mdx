The AI Changes extension enables you to track, review, and manage content modifications made by AI in your editor. It clearly highlights changes, making it easy to see what has been added or removed.

Combine it with the [AI Generation extension](/content-ai/capabilities/generation/overview) to create content and provide your users with a seamless review workflow.
