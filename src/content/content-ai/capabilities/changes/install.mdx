import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'

The AI Changes extension is distributed as an npm package. You can download it from our private registry. In this section, we explain how to install and set it up.

## Install the extension

<Callout title="Subscription required" variant="warning">

This extension requires a valid Entry, Business or Enterprise subscription. To install the extension you need access to our [private registry](/guides/pro-extensions), set this up first.

</Callout>

Once done, you can install the extension from our private registry:

```bash
npm install @tiptap-pro/extension-ai
```

## Initialize the extension

The integration into your editor instance is done like every other Tiptap extension. This is an example on how it could look like:

```js
import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'
import AiChanges from '@tiptap-pro/extension-ai-changes'

const editor = new Editor{
  extensions: [
    StarterKit,
    AiChanges,
    // â€¦ more extensions
  ],
})
```

You will also need to set up the CSS styles so that the changes are visible in the editor.

```css
:root {
  --color-green-100: oklch(0.962 0.044 156.743);
  --color-green-700: oklch(0.527 0.154 150.069);
  --color-red-100: oklch(0.936 0.032 17.717);
  --color-red-700: oklch(0.505 0.213 27.518);
}

.tiptap-ai-changes--old,
.tiptap-ai-changes--old > * {
  color: var(--color-red-700);
  background-color: var(--color-red-100);
}

.tiptap-ai-changes--new,
.tiptap-ai-changes--new > * {
  color: var(--color-green-700);
  background-color: var(--color-green-100);
}
```

## Display the changes

To display the changes, trigger the `startTrackingAiChanges` command. After it is called, the extension will start comparing the current editor content with any new content that is generated by the AI.

```
editor.commands.startTrackingAiChanges()
```

Then, modify the editor content, either by writing on it yourself or by using the [Ai Generation](/content-ai/capabilities/generation/overview) extension to generate new content with AI. The changes will be immediately displayed in the editor.

## Stop displaying the changes

To stop displaying the changes, trigger the `acceptAllAiChanges` command. After it is called, all changes will be accepted and the editor will stop displaying the changes diff.

```
editor.commands.acceptAllAiChanges()
```

Learn more about the available commands to review, accept and reject changes in the [reviewing content guide](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/features/review-changes).
