The AI Changes extension for Tiptap accepts different settings to configure the global behavior of the extension and the commands.

## Custom Styles

The `getCustomDecorations` function allows you to control the appearance of the changed text. Apply custom CSS classes to the text, and add custom elements before and after it. Useful for showing popovers, tooltips, or icons.

It receives these arguments:

- `change`: The change object that contains the information about the change.
- `changes`: A list of all found changes.
- `isSelected`: A boolean that indicates if the change is selected. A change is selected when the cursor is on top of it.
- `getDefaultDecorations`: A function that returns the default decorations for the change. If the `getCustomDecorations` function is not provided, the default decorations will be used.
- `editor`: The Editor instance.
- `previousDoc`: The previous document before the AI made changes. The changes are obtained by comparing the current document with this one.
- `currentDoc`: The current document after the AI made changes.

```ts
AiChanges.configure({
  getCustomDecorations({ change, isSelected, getDefaultDecorations }) {
    // You can combine the default decorations of the AI Changes extension with your custom ones
    const decorations = getDefaultDecorations()

    // Add a custom element after the inserted text of the change
    if (isSelected) {
      decorations.push(
        Decoration.widget(change.newRange.to, () => {
          const element = document.createElement('span')

          element.textContent = 'âœ…'
          return element
        }),
      )
    }
    return decorations
  },
})
```

The custom styles and elements are implemented with the [Prosemirror Decorations API](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#view.Decorations).
