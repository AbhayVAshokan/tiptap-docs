Use Tiptap’s `extension-export-docx` to export editor content as a `.docx` file. This integrates export functionality into your editor.

You can use this extension under any JavaScript environment, including server-side applications due to the isomorphic nature of the new `convert` function.

You can also use the [REST API](/conversion/import-export/docx/rest-api) instead if you'd prefer to handle the conversion on our end.

By default, the extension maps standard DOCX elements to Tiptap nodes. If your content includes custom nodes, configure their [export behavior](/conversion/import-export/docx/custom-node-conversion) to ensure they’re properly converted.

<Callout title="Private registry access" variant="warning">
    To install the extension, you need [access to our
    private registry](/guides/pro-extensions). Set this up before proceeding.
</Callout>

## Install the DOCX Export extension

Install and import the **Export DOCX** extension package

```bash
npm i @tiptap-pro/extension-export-docx
```

Using the export extension does not require any Tiptap Conversion credentials, since the conversion is handled right away in the extension.

```js
import { ExportDocx } from '@tiptap-pro/extension-export-docx'
```

## Export a DOCX file
With the extension installed, you can convert your editor’s content to `.docx`.

After conversion, simply create a Blob from the returned data and prompt the user to download the file.

Before diving into an example, let's take a look into the signature of the `exportDocx` method:

```ts
/**
* Export the current document as a .docx file
*
* Notes: 'buffer' and 'stream' export types are only available in the server environment
* as they use the Node Buffer and Stream APIs respectively
*
* @param onCompleteExport - Callback function to handle the exported file
* @param options - Export options
* @param customNodes - Custom node definitions to ensure proper conversion
* @param styleOverrides - Custom styles to apply to the exported document
* @example editor.commands.exportDocx((result) => {}, { exportType: 'buffer' }, [])
*
*/
exportDocx: (
  onCompleteExport: (result: Buffer | string | Blob | Stream) => void,
  options: ExportDocxOptions,
  customNodes: CustomNode[],
  styleOverrides: IStylesOptions,
) => ReturnType
```

The `exportDocx` method takes three arguments:

- **onCompleteExport**: A callback function that receives the exported data. You can then handle the data as needed (e.g., prompt a file download).
- **options**: An object to configure some parts of the export.
  - **exportType**: The type of data returned by the method. You can choose between:
    - **buffer**: Returns a Node.js Buffer object (server-side only as it requires `node:buffer` API).
    - **stream**: Returns a Node.js Stream object (server-side only as it requires `node:stream` API).
    - **string**: Returns a string.
    - **blob** (`default`): Returns a Blob object.
- **customNodes**: An array of custom node definitions. If your content includes custom nodes, pass their definitions here to ensure they’re properly converted. We will get into this in a specific section.
- **styleOverrides**: An object with custom styles to apply to the exported document. Use this to override the default export styles. We will get into this in a specific section.


```js
 editor
  .chain()
  .exportDocx(
    result => {
      // You can, for instance, handle loading states here
      loading = true;
      // Create a Blob from the exported data to download it for the user
      const blob = new Blob([result], {
        type: 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document',
      })
      const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
      const a = document.createElement('a')
      a.href = url
      a.download = 'export.docx'
      a.click()
      URL.revokeObjectURL(url)
    },
    {
      exportType: 'blob',
    },
  )
  .run()
```

### How it works

The above example runs entirely in the browser, generating a DOCX Blob via the ExportDocx extension. We then programmatically download the file. You can adjust this logic, for instance, to send the blob to a server instead of downloading.

- **callback**: When the conversion completes, we will get the `result` of the conversion as the main and only argument to the callback function which, in this case, it would be a `Blob` since we've declared that we wanted this type in the `exportType` within the `options` parameter. You can then handle it however you prefer, e.g. prompting a file download, like we showcased in the example above.
- **options**: We've set `{ exportType: 'blob' }` so the conversion returns a `Blob`.
- **customNodes**: We won't provide any custom node mapping since we are not providing any custom nodes.
- **styleOverrides**: We won't provide any style overrides, and therefore, a default `DOCX` style set crafter following some common guideliness from Microsoft Word defaults will be applied to the exported document.

## Server-side export
For applications requiring complex document generation or to reduce client-side bundle size, you can export `.docx` files your the server.

In order to do so, you'd need to import the `convert` function from the `@tiptap-pro/extension-export-docx` package, pass it your Tiptap JSON content, and return the resulting buffer to the client.

Here you have a simple example using `Express` and `@tiptap-pro/extension-export-docx` on the server-side:


```js
import { convert } from '@tiptap-pro/extension-export-docx'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()

app.post('/export-docx', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Get Tiptap JSON content from the request
    const { content } = req.body

    // Convert Tiptap JSON to DOCX
    const docxBuffer = await convert(content)

    // Send as a downloadable file
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document')
    res.setHeader('Content-Disposition', 'attachment; filename="document.docx"')
    res.send(docxBuffer)
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message })
  }
})
```

## Support & Limitations
Exporting `.docx` files from Tiptap JSON provides a way to handle most standard Word content, but **it’s not a one-to-one mapping** due to inherent differences between DOCX formatting and Tiptap’s CSS-based styles.
