Integrating **DOCX** (Microsoft Word) conversion with your Tiptap editor can be done in several ways.

Each method focuses on a different workflow, from providing in-editor menu options for users to import or export, to server-side integrations via the REST API.

## Editor extensions
The editor extensions provide straightforward ways to add “Import DOCX” or “Export DOCX” functionality directly into your editor UI. For example, you might add these options to a toolbar menu, letting users instantly import a Word document or export the current content as a `.docx` file.

### Editor Import
If you want to let users upload Word documents directly into your editor for example, via an “Import DOCX” button, see [DOCX Editor import](/conversion/import-export/docx/editor-import). It covers:
- Installing and configuring the Import extension.
- Converting `.docx` files into Tiptap JSON and displaying the content in your editor.
- Handling images, basic formatting, and styles during import.

### Editor Export
If you want to give users a menu option or toolbar button to download their current editor content as a `.docx` file, see [DOCX Editor export](/conversion/import-export/docx/editor-export). This guide explains:
- How to install/configure the export to docx extension
- Handling images, formatting, and custom styling in the exported Word file.

## When to use the REST API
For server-side or external DOCX conversions—like batch processing documents or handling imports/exports without a Tiptap editor—see [DOCX conversion REST API](/conversion/import-export/docx/rest-api). With it, you can:
- Send `.docx` files for import, receiving Tiptap JSON.
- Provide Tiptap JSON for export, receiving `.docx` in return.
- Control how nodes and marks map to your schema.

<Callout title="Custom nodes" variant="hint">
    If you have **custom nodes** that you need preserved in the `.docx` output, the REST API **cannot** handle that. Instead, you must implement the **Editor Export** extension on your **own server** to manage custom node conversion yourself.
</Callout>

## Custom nodes and overridden styles
If your editor uses custom Tiptap extensions like special node types beyond the standard paragraphs, lists, tables, etc. or you need deeper control over Word styling, check:
- [Export styles for DOCX export](/conversion/import-export/docx/export-styles)
- [Custom nodes for DOCX export](/conversion/import-export/docx/custom-node-conversion)

These advanced guides walk you through defining custom renderers for non-standard nodes and applying extra style rules to the `.docx` output.
