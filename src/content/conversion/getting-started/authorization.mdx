## Set up authorization

The conversion service requires authentication for all requests. This is handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and a unique App ID for your account. Before using import/export, you need to obtain credentials and generate a JWT.
<Callout title="Only for Testing" variant="warning"> Creating a JWT via third-party tools or in client-side code is **only for testing purposes**. **Never expose your secret key in client-side code or share it publicly.** For production, always generate tokens securely on your server. </Callout>

1. **Get your App ID and Secret Key:** Log in to your Tiptap Cloud account and navigate to the [Convert settings](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/convert-settings) page. There you’ll find a Convert App ID and a secret key for conversion. You will use the App ID in requests, and the secret key to sign your JWTs.
2. **Create a JWT for development:** During development or testing, you might create a short-lived token manually. One quick way is to use an online JWT generator (for example, the JWT Builder tool). Input a simple payload (e.g. a user or project ID) and use your convert secret key as the signing key. This will produce a JWT string.
3. **Generate JWTs on your server:** In a production environment, you must create JWTs server-side to keep the secret key safe. Head over to our [Collaboration authentication guide](/collaboration/getting-started/authenticate#integrate-jwt-server-side) to get help. **Make sure to use your Convert JWT secret though!**

Once you have a JWT, you’ll include it in your conversion requests. In the context of the editor extensions, you will configure the extension with your App ID and this JWT (as shown in the Usage sections). For direct API calls, you will use the JWT in the Authorization header and the App ID in a header as well.
