The Tiptap Conversion Service makes it easy to import and export content between Tiptap and document file formats. It offers:
- **Import**: Convert files (Word `DOCX`, OpenOffice/LibreOffice `ODT`, or `Markdown` files) into Tiptap’s JSON document format.
- **Export**: Turn Tiptap JSON back into `DOCX`, `ODT`, or `MD`.
- **REST API**: Use HTTP endpoints to integrate conversion into a backend or external application (no Tiptap editor required).
- **Editor Extensions**: Use built-in Tiptap Pro extensions to import/export directly within a Tiptap editor instance.

## Current limitations

Some document features are not yet supported or have limited support:

- **Document structure** – Page-related features such as multiple sections, page breaks, headers, footers, and watermarks are excluded.
- **Advanced references** – Elements like comments, revision marks (track changes), table of contents, footnotes, and endnotes are not yet supported.
- **Complex formatting** – Advanced layout options (e.g., multi-column layouts, text direction, text boxes, shapes) are currently unsupported.
- **Interactive content** – Form fields, macros, or embedded scripts in the document are ignored.
- **Other** – Document metadata is not transferred. Equations, charts, and SmartArt/diagram elements also do not convert.

We are continuously improving the conversion service. Support for page breaks, headers/footers, references like footnotes, and other complex features is in active development.
