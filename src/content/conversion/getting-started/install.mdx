import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'

Tiptap Conversion helps you import and export Tiptap JSON in various formats — including **DOCX**, **ODT**, **Markdown**, and **GitHub-flavored Markdown**.

You can integrate Import or Export extensions directly into your Tiptap editor, or call the Conversion REST API from your server.

## Set up authorization

The conversion service requires authentication for all requests. This is handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and a unique App ID for your account. Before using import/export, obtain your credentials and generate a JWT.

<Callout title="Only for Testing" variant="warning">
    Creating a JWT via third-party tools or in client-side code is **only for testing purposes**. **Never expose your secret key in client-side code or share it publicly.** For production, always generate tokens securely on your server.
</Callout>

1. **Get your App ID and Secret Key:** Log in to your Tiptap Cloud account and navigate to the [Convert settings](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/convert-settings) page. There you’ll find a Convert App ID and a secret key. Use the App ID in requests and the secret key to sign your JWTs.
2. **Create a JWT for development:** For development or testing, you might create a short-lived token manually. One quick way is to use an online JWT generator (e.g., JWT Builder). Input a simple payload (like a user or project ID) and use your convert secret key as the signing key to produce a JWT string.
3. **Generate JWTs on your server:** In production, always create JWTs server-side to keep the secret key safe. See our [Collaboration authentication guide](/collaboration/getting-started/authenticate#integrate-jwt-server-side) for details (use your **Convert** secret key for conversion tokens).

Once you have a JWT, include it in your conversion requests. For the editor extensions, configure the extension with your App ID and this JWT (as shown in usage examples). For direct API calls, use the JWT in the `Authorization` header and the App ID in the `X-App-Id` header.

## Import methods

When importing content into Tiptap:

- **Frontend Import**: Use the Import extension in your Tiptap editor. This lets users load `.docx`, `.odt`, `.md`, `.markdown`, or `.rtf` files directly into the editor. The extension uploads the file to Tiptap’s conversion service and sets your editor’s content to the converted result.

```bash
npm i @tiptap-pro/extension-import
```

Alternatively, send the file to Tiptap’s Conversion REST API from your backend.

## Export methods
If you have minimal or no custom extensions in your editor schema, you can use the basic Export extension. It handles all standard nodes and can map unknown nodes to standard ones, but does not support defining entirely custom output or advanced styling.

```bash
npm i @tiptap-pro/extension-export
```
Or send your editor’s JSON to Tiptap’s conversion REST endpoint to get back a .docx, .odt, or .md file. See the REST API for details.
