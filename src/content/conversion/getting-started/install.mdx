Tiptap Conversion helps you import and export Tiptap JSON in various formats—including `DOCX`, `ODT`, `Markdown`, and `GitHub-flavored Markdown`.

You can integrate Import or Export extensions directly into your Tiptap editor or call the Conversion REST API from your server.

## Import methods

When importing content into Tiptap:

**Frontend Import**: Integrate the Import extension in your Tiptap editor. This lets users load `.docx`, `.odt`, `.md`, `.markdown`, or `rtf` files directly into the editor. The extension automatically converts the uploaded document into Tiptap JSON and sets your editor’s content.

```bash
npm i @tiptap-pro/extension-import
```

Alternatively, send the file to Tiptap’s Conversion [REST API]().


## Export methods
If you have minimal or no custom extensions in your editor schema you can integrate `extension-export`. It supports mapping custom nodes to standard Tiptap nodes, but does **not** allow detailed custom node definitions or advanced styling.

```bash
npm i @tiptap-pro/extension-export
```

Or send your editor’s JSON to Tiptap’s **REST** endpoint to get back a `.docx`, `.odt`, or `.md` file. See [REST API]() for more details.

### Advanced DOCX support

`extension-export-docx` provides more control over how custom nodes and marks are rendered in the final DOCX.

This is especially relevant if your editor integrates custom Tiptap extensions and you want those reflected in Word documents.

```bash
npm i @tiptap-pro/extension-export-docx
```

**Frontend or Backend**
This advanced extension can run in the browser (client-side) or on a Node.js server (server-side). The outcome is the same: a customized `.docx` file with your custom configuration accurately represented.

<Callout title="Recommendation" variant="hint">
    If you have (or plan to have) custom nodes/marks in your Tiptap editor and need to export to DOCX with those features intact, install `@tiptap-pro/extension-export-docx`.
